# Snake_game
This repository contains the codes of the classic snake game recreated by me. 
main.py is the heart of the code that's where the game works
snake.py contains the behaviours and method related to snake
food.py randomly generates food
score_board.py prints the score and game over text
All of the code is written in python using turtle module
